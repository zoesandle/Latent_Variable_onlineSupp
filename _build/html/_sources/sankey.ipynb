    "\n",
    "In this plot, we can see how the reporting types feed into each other for all the variables (answering the question whether studies only using self report for one of the variables are more likely to use self report for other variables as well). In contrast to the other dataframes, the reporting types are not exploded, meaning that studies using multiple reporting types are not fed into multiple measures. The left column is the P/CU trait column, the middle the behavioral and the left column contains the cognitive variable reporting types. For readability, some variable names have been abbreviated (in the behavioral: self report = s, other report = o; in the cognitive: self report = self, other report = other)."

    "As a tentative interpretation, it seems to me that group solutions of 3 mostly result in spectrum driven solution ('salsa' effect), meaning that there is a low, middle and high group that are not or only minimally different in a qualitative way. Four and five class solutions result mostly in qualitatively different profiles, with usually one large reference/low CU/psychopathic traits group, one that is consistently high, and two that are higher on only affective or behavioral traits. When there is variation, this occurs more on the behavioral traits. Often, outcomes also quantitatively and qualitatively differ between these groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another conclusion is that while different facets of psychopathy/CU traits exist on a spectrum and thus psychopathic traits themselves are a spectrum as well, they don't always neatly combine in a linear way. While the consistently high traits group often differ the most on aggression from the consistently low groups, groups high only behavioral/CU traits differ from the other groups in quantitative *and* qualitative ways (see e.g. involvement in different criminal activities or different cognitive outcomes). There was only one study on our dataset that predicted offense types and CU traits from cognitive variables (Piehler, 2019). The authors in this study draw the conclusion that both cognitively inflexible and emotionally disregulated youth tend to exhibit more conduct problems and externalizing behaviors, but differ in both *severity* and, crucially, in *type*. They suggest that there might be different developmental pathways leading to disruptive behavior disorders, that may also result in different behavioral subtypes. \n",

    "We draw some tentative recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When performing LCA/LPA with psychopathic/CU traits as a sole predictor, one should aim for a class solution of >= 4. This gives a more qualitatively meaningful solution. If a solution of 2 or 3 is strongly preferred, then a linear regression might be indicated instead to actually cover the entire spectrum of the scale. \n",
    "2. When performing LCA/LPA with multiple predictors, this recommendation can be relaxed slightly, though the statistical indicators may favor a group solution with 4+ groups anyway. \n",
    "3. There is currently and underutilization of cognitive variables as predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the wider project and studies utilizing other modeling approaches such as factor analysis and growth analysis (see poster):\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generally, person-centered approaches such as LCA/LPA find more (meaningful) group solutions than variable centered ones (growth models find more than LPA still). This is a good indicator that these approaches may be more adept at capturing the very real heterogeneity of how these variables tend to present (in patients/the community) and their outcomes. However, all of these approaches run under the assumption of linearity. It is quite likely though (and the data presented here support this idea as well) that associations are not linear. We should try to find some modeling approaches that do not work on linear assumptions. "
