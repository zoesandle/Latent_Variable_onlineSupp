# Welcome to Supplemental Materials for SSSP ECE Poster Session 2025

On this Github page I've hosted some additional materials that might be of interest. I show 
1. Some plots showing flow of variables to the scales used and the type of reporting (e.g. if it was self reported). These are called Sankey Plots.
2. The overview of studies utilizing LCA/LPA, their group solutions and some descriptions.
3. Some very tentative conclusions

I am very happy to receive any comments, feedback, or questions at zoesandle@donders.ru.nl.
